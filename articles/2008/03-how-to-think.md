From [this post](http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/boyden/21925/)

1.  Synthesize new ideas all the time. No passive reading. Annotate,
    model,think and synthesize what you read.
2.  Learn how to learn (rapidly).
3.  Work backwards from the goal.
4.  Have long-term plan. It might change but you should have it.
5.  Make contingency maps. Draw dependencies on a big piece of paper,
    first finish things that donâ€™t depend on anything but on which other
    items depend.
6.  Collaborate.
7.  Make mistakes quickly.
8.  As you learn, write up best-practices protocols.
9.  Document obsessively.
10. Keep it simple.

Logarithmic time planning: the closer the event, the more granular
scheduling.
