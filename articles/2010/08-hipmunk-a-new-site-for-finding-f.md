A new web service [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com/) just launched. They
offer a new interface for finding flights (which then can be booked
through Orbitz).

In the past I’ve used every flight finding service there is (Kayak,
Orbitz etc.) and after giving Hipmunk a try I have to say: their way of
showing the results is much better.

I wonder how defensible their startup is. All other services could just
copy their interface. That usually doesn’t happen quickly (or at all) in
case of big, established players with a lot of inertia and politics, but
recently I read an article about Kayak which touted it as a bad-ass,
agile, quickly innovating company and if Kayak is all that, it shouldn’t
take them long to copy that interface.

For now [Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com/) is certainly my new preferred
flight finding website.
