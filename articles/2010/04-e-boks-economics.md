Key data from [New Yorker article on
e-books](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/26/100426fa_fact_auletta?currentPage=all):

-   typical pricing of a hard-cover book:
    -   bookstore price: $26
    -   whole-sale price for the bookstore: 50% ($13)
    -   author royalty: about 15% of the cover price ($3.90)
    -   bookstores return about 40% of hard-covers, $5.2 per book on average
    -   $3 is for printing and shipping
    -   publisher profit: about $1 ($15 - $3.90 - $5.2 - $3)
-   e-book royalties for the author: 25%
-   before agency model pricing, Amazon was buying e-books for $13 and
    selling for $9. The assumption is that Amazon is taking short-term
    loss to set low price expectation for e-books so that in the future
    they can sell more e-books and kill bookstores (therefore make more
    money)
-   in agency model, publisher is considered the seller. Publisher sets
    the price and Amazon acts as an “agent”, taking 30% of the price
    (70% going to the publisher)
-   ironically, in agency model, books cost more and publishers get less
    money (although probably only as long as Amazon is willing to sell
    at a loss)
-   estimated 3 million Kindles
-   450.000 Kindle titles
-   60.000 iBooks titles
-   12 million books digitized by Google
-   Open Road Integrated Media, founded by C.E.O. of HarperCollins,
    plans 50% royalty to authors
-   Amazon tried to strike deals directly with authors, offering them
    70% royalty, as long as they agree to a $2.99-$9.99 price
-   of more than 100.000 published books, 70% doesn’t earn back advance
    on royalties
-   6 biggest publishers produce 60% of all books sold in the U.S.

Note: some numbers are as of April 2010 and will surely change in the
future.
