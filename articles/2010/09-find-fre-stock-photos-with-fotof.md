Iâ€™ve just released my first commercial program:
[Fotofi](/software/fotofi/).

Fotofi is designed to make it easier to find free stock photos. It
searches more than 100 million photos that are published on Flickr under
one of the [Creative Common](http://creativecommons.org/) licenses and
allows easy filtering by license and size and downloading photographs
locally.
