--------------
New versions of Windows have a feature of automatically re-installing
files if they have been deleted/modified. It's a way to protect vital
system files from accidental deletion or being modified by a virus.
Usually it is a good thing but sometimes it prevents you from doing
something useful e.g. replacing notepad.exe with something better. [This
article](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B222473)
describes how to disable WFP.
