Software production outsourcing is a popular and re-current topic on
Joel's forum. [This thread](http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=34287&ixReplies=68) has a few interesting posts about realities of doing software in India and China. Here's the China part:

> which requires better infastructure. In Xiamen, small city on the

> $100/month for unskilled labor, and $300 would be towards the top
