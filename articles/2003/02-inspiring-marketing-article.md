[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) has
written [an iteresting marketing article](http://web.archive.org/web/20041104043156/http://www.fastcompany.com:80/online/67/purplecow.html).

The gist of it is that today being good is not good enough, you have to be
outstanding in some way. You need to be a Purple Cow.
