An interesting article [What Should I Do With My Life?](http://web.archive.org/web/20040823082806/http://www.fastcompany.com:80/online/66/mylife.html). This caught my attention:

> It turns out that having the ﬁnancial independence to walk away rarely
> triggers people to do just that. The reality is, making money is such
> hard work that it changes you. It takes twice as long as anyone plans
> for. It requires more sacriﬁces than anyone expects. You become so
> emotionally invested in that world -- and psychologically adapted to
> it -- that you don't really want to ditch it.
