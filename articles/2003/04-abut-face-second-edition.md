I became a fan of Alan Cooper after reading [The Inmates Are Running The Asylum](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672316498/).

I then read About Face. I was pleasantly surprised when I found a [new
edition of About Face](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764526413/) while strolling through my local Barnes & Noble.

Cooper is successful, opinionated and makes sense.

If UI design, oops, I mean interaction design, is your thing, go and read the book.
