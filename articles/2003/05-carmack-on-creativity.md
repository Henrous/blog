This John Carmack's quote is worth remembering:

> "Putting creativity on a pedestal can also be an excuse for laziness.
> There is a lot of cultural belief that creativity comes from inspiration, and
> can't be rushed. Not true. Inspiration is just your subconscious putting things
> together, and that can be made into an active process with a little introspection.
>  Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and
> just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren't sure which
> way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better." - John Carmack
