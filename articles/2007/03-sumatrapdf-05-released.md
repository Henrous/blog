--------------
This release comes a little sooner that I planned but I wanted to fix
rendering issues that cropped in version 0.4 when I switched the default
rendering engine from poppler to mupdf. I fixed all the issues reported
on the forums and in the bug tracker.

But I didn't stop there. I've also made some bugfixes and speedups so
the application should feel more snappy and you should see "please wait"
message less often plus I re-enabled predictive rendering of the next
page (which got lost in version 0.4), for even better and faster reading
experience.

Caching has been improved so SumatraPDF shouldn't consume as much memory
as it used to in long reading sessions.

I've added keyboard shortcuts for rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise
(Ctrl-Shift-+ and Ctrl-Shift--, just like Acrobat Reader). This was
suggested recently on the forums.

And finally I added an About menu.

Enjoy!
