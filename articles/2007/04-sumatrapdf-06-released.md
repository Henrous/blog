--------------
I've just released another version of [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). This version mostly fixes bugs. The changes in this release are:

  * enable opening password-protected PDFs
  * don't allow printing in PDFs that have printing forbidden
  * don't automatically reopen files at startup
  * fix opening PDFs from network shares
  * new, better icon
  * reload the document when changing rendering engine
  * improve cursor shown when dragging
  * fix toolbar appearance on XP and Vista with classic theme
  * when MuPDF engine cannot load a file or render a page, we fallbackto poppler engine to make rendering more robust
  * fixed a few crashes
