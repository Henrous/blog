Title: Merge tools showdown

Recently I've been spending a lot of time merging files (I need to merge
translation files for Sumatra PDF that people send me) so a good merging
tools is valuable.

On Windows, there are at least 3 good diff/merge tools.

[Araxis Merge](http://www.araxis.com/merge/) is a really nice but
expensive.

[WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) is token open-source product. It's not
as flashy as Araxis Merge but in some ways it's better (more key
bindings that speedup merging). I've used it with great success for
merging source code but for dealing with translations it has
deal-breaking limitation: it doesn't support utf-8 encoded text.

And the winner is:
[DiffMerge](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html), which has
been recently re-released with the price of $0. It might be not as
flashy as Araxis Merge, but it has good merge workflow and support utf-8
encoded text.
