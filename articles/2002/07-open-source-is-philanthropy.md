From now defunct blog:

> Business is business, and business loves proprietary patented
> technology with its pseudo monopolies used to leverage revenue and
> increase value. These kind of leverage points used to drive income are
> noticeably missing in the open source model. Instead, businesses
> focusing on open source tend to use the services model for revenue. It
> makes a lot of business sense to use open source software in your
> business, but it doesn't make much sense to produce open source
> software in your business.

I meant to write about impossibility of making money **writing** open
source but this guy was there first.
