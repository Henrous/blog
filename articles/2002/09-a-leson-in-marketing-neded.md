It looks like many companies need
a marketing lesson. Here's aÂ ["marketing"
description](http://web.archive.org/web/20030412162306/http://www.xengames.com:80/productsif.htm) of a game:

> Interstellar Flames is an intense action game featuring a groundbreaking
> 3d engine for the Pocket PC.
>
> Product Features:
> - Blindingly fast 3D graphics and gameplay
> - Fully perspective corrected texture mapping
> - Mipmapping
> - Particle engine
> - Transparent smoke effect
> - Shadow effect

Do they really think that people care about their 3D engine?

Do they think that people know what mipmapping is? Or particle engine?

This thing has clearly been written by a programmer who's so proud about
his technical achievements that he fails to see that people don't care
about them.

Bad marketing.
