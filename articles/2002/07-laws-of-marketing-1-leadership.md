[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says:
being first in the market is better than having a better product than a
competition. Examples: we all remember who first flew over Atlantic or
who was the first man on the moon but almost no-one knows who was the
second. Heineken was the first imported beer in USA and still is No. 1
imported beer. Same for Miller Lite, first domestic light beer. Being
first doesn't matter if the idea/product is not good.

*My comments:* *I think it's better to say that being first gives one
extremely big advantage over competition but doesn't guarantee the
success. It's rather obvious that it doesn't matter that you're first to
market if no-one needs your product or if your product is very bad.
There are many examples from computer industry that disprove this rule
(i.e. first spreadsheet isn't the dominant spreadsheet, first word
processor isn't the dominant word processor) so there are (many) cases
showing that n-th product can overtake early leaders. But it's very hard
and usually requires the leader to make huge mistakes.*
