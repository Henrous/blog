The ability to watch [this wonderful Wozniak's
speech](http://wean1.ulib.org/cgi-bin/metawin-lectures.pl?target=Lectures/Distinguished%20Lectures/2002)
many days after it has been given in a place I've never seen represents
the best of Internet: shift the time, shrink the space, provide more
equal access to interesting information.

Another observation is that [Wozniak](http://www.woz.org/)'s story (who
co-founded Apple with Jobs) confirms my theory about success: all you
need to achieve success is a lot of hard work. This talk is a very
compressed story of Wozniak's technical progress, from 5th grade till
the creating Apple and more. And his story is so refreshing given the
the recent realization (as a result of dot-com bomb) that being driven
by greed and get-rich-fast schemes isn't a viable long-term strategy.
Wozniak was a brilliant, hard-working engineer. And he would remain so
even if he didn't make a killing on Apple. Brilliance is not enough to
make a difference, he was lucky but luck is always a tip of the iceberg.
The foundation on which the success rests is hard work.
