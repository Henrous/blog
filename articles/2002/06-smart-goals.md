Recently I've read tons of books on how to become more effective, how to
achieve more. They don't always agree on the answer but there's one thing they all agree: you have to set goals. Goals should be **SMART**. They should be:

  * **S**pecific
  * **M**easurable
  * **A**chievable
  * **R**esults oriented
  * **T**ime-bound

Do you set yourself goals? What do you want to achieve in the next week, next month, next year, next 5 years?
