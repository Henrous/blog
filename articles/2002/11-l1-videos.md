Accidently, a day after I watched [LL2
webcast](http://ll2.ai.mit.edu) on-line, I got in my mail a CD with
videos from [LL1](http://ll1.mit.edu/) (which you can order from [Dr.
Dobb's](http://www.digitalriver.com/dr/v2/ec_MAIN.Entry10?xid=2823&SP=10023&PN=1&V1=387427)).
Talks from LL1 actually interest me more. LL1 had talks about Arc,
Rebol, Parrot, Goo. Good stuff.
