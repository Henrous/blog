I've seen some people bitching about new WinAmp
3 but I like it.

Free-form skins are awesome. I'll probably settle for something clean and functional but it's so much fun checking out all those crazy, beautiful skins.

WinAmp might not look like much but in my opinion it teaches a few
important lessons in software developement and marketing.

**WinAmp is a platform.**

WinAmp isn't just a music (and now video) player, it's a
[platform](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/08/30/platforms/). All
the user-contributed skins, visualization components help WinAmp fend
off competition, even from those who can include competing player in the
OS itself.

**WinAmp is not only useful, it's also desireable.**

The first priority when designing software is to make something useful and functional.

But when your competition's stuff is as functional as yours, you have to do better, you have to compete in desirability.

Apple is a good example: their iPod doesn't play mp3
better than other players but it does look cool and that allows Apple
charge for it more.

WinAmp also does a lot of things that don't contribute much to functionality but a lot to desirability:

* tasteful splash screen with a reference to a recent boxoffice hit
* visualizations
* skins
* animated "about box".

**WinAmp is masterfully marketed.**

WinAmp website  has it's own, distinctive voice.

You won't find there cliched market speak ("our product is leading blah,
blah...").

Web site is well designed, tasteful and functional.

It has forums so that people can talk about their products.

It has plenty of documentation.

While this exact style might not be appropriate for every software company, many could learn a lot from guys at WinAmp.
