There goes the theory of superiority of high-level languages. Second prize in [Fifth ICFP Programming Contest][1] went to a program written in C.

That pretty much settles the question that doesn't seem to to get off people's mind: are high-level languages better for writing software (where high-level means "higher level than C")?

One might think that the fact that the winning entry was in Objective Caml proves that high-level programming languages are indeed better but the important fact here is that entry in C was better than a lot of other entries written in Python, Lisp, Java, Haskell, OCaml etc.

And here's my revelation: it's not the language, it's the programmer.
