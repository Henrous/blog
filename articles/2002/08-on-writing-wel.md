Good writing is the basis for weblogging. Good books about how to write
learn are [On writing
well](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060006641/) and [Style:
toward clarity and
grace](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226899152/). If you don't
feel like reading books, this list might help as well:

> -   Avoid alliteration.
> -   Prepositions dangle awkwardly if you use them to end sentences
>     with.
> -   Avoid clichés and colloquialisms like the plague, or you will seem
>     old hat.
> -   Employ the vernacular, while eschewing arcane and obfuscatory
>     verbiage.
> -   Avoid ampersands & abbreviations, etc.
> -   Take it easy with parenthetical remarks (however relevant), to
>     avoid chopping up sentences (unnecessarily (we might add)).
> -   To ever, however artfully, split an infinitive, marks you as
>     grammatically challenged.
> -   Skip the foreign words and phrases you know, n’est-ce pas?
> -   Never generalize.
> -   “I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.” –Ralph Waldo Emerson
> -   Comparisons can clog up writing as badly as alliterations and
>     cliches.
> -   Avoid redundancy and verbosity, or readers will think you are
>     repeating yourself and using too many words as well besides.
> -   We really get @\*&%\$\*\*)!! when you use vulgarities.
> -   Clear, specific writing beats vagueness, we suppose. Whatever.
> -   Overstatement totally destroys any credibility you ever had
>     forever.
> -   Understatement can, at times, perhaps shade a point to the point
>     of its fading away.
> -   One word sentences? Eliminate.
> -   Analogies work about as well as fur on a flounder.
> -   “Is” just sits there. Pick verbs that do something.
> -   Even if a mixed metaphor sings, you should derail it.
> -   Who needs rhetorical questions?
> -   Its distrakting too punctuat, an spel rong.

Good writing is surprisingly hard.
