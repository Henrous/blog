I'm a programmer so [this
post](http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?mmp:7790) was at first
hard to swallow:

> *Ah, well, I think the market in my profession is working just fine.

> confused enough to think that market value is the same as intrinsic
> value). And even at my pay scale I still have time to read mailing

But after some reflection I can't help but agree. We (programmers) are
just lucky bustards. There's [another
post](http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?msn:7705:fhhnpeaonhppkeodanan>)
presenting similar perspective. Both posts come from a Free Software
Business [mailing list](http://www.crynwr.com/fsb/). Don't expect to
find there a receipt on how to make money on free/open source software
(we're still waiting for The One who will figure outÂ a reproducible way
to do that). Expect intelligent people engaging in interesting
conversations.
