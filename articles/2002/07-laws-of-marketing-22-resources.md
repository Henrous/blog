[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says:
without adequate funding an idea won't get off the ground. You need a
lot of money to market your ideas.

*My comment: on one hand you can read it as a "don't fool yourself"
advice. On the other hand authors promote indiscriminate spending of
money of advertising without any mention of the fact that sometimes
advertisement doesn't pay. It seems obvious that you should never spend
more on marketing that you can hope to get out of it in later revenues,
yet the books never says that. It just asserts that you need to spend a
lot on marketing which is a suspicious advice coming from people who do
marketing.*
