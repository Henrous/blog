I bought [High Tech start
up](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/068487170X) because
I've mistaken it for a different book on the subject of start ups I
wanted to buy.

The subtitle of this book is "the complete handbook for creating successful
new high tech companies". Completness is a weakness of this book. Author wanted
to cover all the steps of creating a new company, from getting the idea,
drafting a business plan, getting VC funding to doing an IPO.

He did cover all of those topics but the result is just a boring lundry list of
things to think about. It won't hurt to read it but in real life nothing
will be like what's described in the book.
