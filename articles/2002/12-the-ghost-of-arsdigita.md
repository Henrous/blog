I just started reading [Entrepreneur
America](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/006662066X/) in
which Rob Ryan, founder of Ascent, a succesful company founded in 1989
and sold in 1999 to Lucent for $25 bilion.

Rob, who currently runs boot-cams for entrepreneurs, tells us how to create a succesful business. The book looks very promising. In the first chapter I found this:

> One extreme example of a Technoid team I recently saw comprised over
> twenty "rocket scientists." They had created incredible Web sites to
> build community and encourage collaboration - the users were
> interacting with the sites so much that they were basically generating
> the great content.
>
> They were a freeware company, which meant that the software was given
> away. Revenue came from charging clients who wanted the company's
> expertise on using the software. For that, clients paid $1 million to
> $2 million a year. Obviously the company didn't need many customers
> to be a successful revenue-generating company. So far so good on the
> business model.
>
> The problem was that the company had, at that stage, no administrative
> team, no sales or marketing people. It had engineers, and lots of
> them. In fact, when I met them they were hiring an accountant, but the
> accountant had to be able to code. Not all Technoids are this
> hard-core about the engineering thing. But given the strong bias of
> this particular founder, I was sure that even the receptionist
> answering the phones was probably going to be an engineer.
>
> The company was a loose confederation guided by the founder and his
> co-founder. When I looked at their business model I realised three
> things. It was good, but they didn't have the business people to
> handle the management issues.
>
> He had promised the rest of the engineers that they would be able to
> cash in their stock at some time in the future. But he didn't know how
> to do this while also keeping thight management control over his
> company.
>
> After I met with him briefly, I pointed out a few key things. There
> were several potential companies that could spin out of his technology
> and, with some hard work and a little luck, eventually go public. But
> it would take time and several milestones before that blessed event.
> First, we needed a predictable revenue model. Second, we needed a
> management team with a track record of working together at that
> company.
>
> I ended up drifting away from this team. I believe it could have been
> fun, but only if the founder were a little less Technoid.

This sounds like a description of the fallen ArsDigita. So here we have
another theory why ArsDigita failed: Philip Greenspun was too much of
a Technoid.
