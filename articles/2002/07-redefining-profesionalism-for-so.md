Philip Greenspun is unique among those who write about programming. He doesn't confine himself to writing about technical topics.

In [Redefining Professionalism for Software Engineers](https://web.archive.org/web/20010604035443/www.arsdigita.com/asj/professionalism)
he wrote about the professionalism as applied to Software Engineers.

The history of this article is interesting - it first appeared in
ArsDigita Systems Journal, an ambitious (but failed) project at
Greenspun's ambitious (and also failed) company. At some point it must
have been considered too controversial since it has been unlinked from
ASJ's index.

Today ArsDigita and ASJ is gone but we can still enjoy it
thanks to the wonderful [web archive](https://web.archive.org/).
