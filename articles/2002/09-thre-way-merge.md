Rare are the times when a piece of software amazes
me with how good it is. [Araxis Merge](http://www.araxis.com/) just did.
Merging is something that sometimes programmers need to do. People using
source version control system like CVS sometimes start developing code
on a new branch. At some point changes made on the branch need to be
merged into the mainline code. The fun begins when there are merge
conflicts that cannot be resolved automatically, i.e. if since branching
the same piece of code has been modified both in mainline and on a
branch. Someone has to intelligently decide which changes will survive
and which ones will be dropped. Araxis Merge does an excellent job of
helping doing the merge by superbly visualizing the code. Well worth it
if you need to do merges.
