--------------
I present you with [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/) - a new PDF viewer for Windows.

Why another PDF viewer? Because it's more yellow and we need more yellow PDF
viewers for Windows.

Also, the main idea is to make it fast to use, mostly by making the startup
time short. Startup time is really my main issue with Adobe Acrobat Reader.

In the future I would like to make it into a PDF viewer with the best UI. I
have ideas but currently it's version 0.1 and only has the most basic
features.
