This is a debugging story and the lessons learned.

I was writing an application using a
[MailSwitchToAccount](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/mobilesdk5/html/wce51lrfmailswitchtoaccount.asp)
API new in WIndows Mobile 5.0. According to docs it's defined in
cemapi.h and an app needs to link with `cemapi.lib`.

That's how I called it:

```
hr = MailSwitchToAccount(_T("SMS"));
```

Visual Studio 2005 refused to link the app, claiming that:

```
TestDevice.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol
"long __cdecl MailSwitchToAccount(wchar_t const *,unsigned long)"
(?MailSwitchToAccount@@YAJPB_WK@Z) referenced in function "void
__cdecl OnMailSwitchToAccount(void)" (?OnMailSwitchToAccount@@YAXXZ)
```

My first thought was that this symbol is simply missing from cemapi.lib.
So I used dumpbin.exe (part of Visual Studio tools) to dump all symbols
exported from cemapi.lib:

```
dumpbin -exports cemapi.lib
```

I found that it does have MailSwitchToAccount:

```
?MailSwitchToAccount@@YAJPBGK@Z (long __cdecl
MailSwitchToAccount(unsigned short const *,unsigned long))
```

Howerver, if you look closely, you'll see that signatures don't match:
expected type for the first parameter is `unsigned short *` while I'm
calling it as `wchar_t const *`. Now, `unsigned short` is the WCHAR
Windows UNICODE type. C++ also defines `wchar_t` which is also UNICODE
char.

I vaguely remembered that some C++ compilers have an option to treat
`wchar_t` as a native language type (as opposed to just a typedef for
existing type, `unsigned short` in Windows' case).

And indeed, there it was, in project properties, C/C++/Language there's an option "Treat
wchar_t as Built-in Type", set by default to Yes.

You can set it to "No", which corresponds to passing `/Zc:wchar_t-` to cl.exe.

It seems wrong that you have to do that. It seems like
`cemapi.dll/cemapi.lib` were compiled with `/Zc:wchar_t-` which forces
everyone who links to them also be compiled like that.

Lessons learned:

-   C++ is evil
-   dumpbin.exe is your friend
-   Visual Studio's code browsing is your friend (it's easy to find out
    what a given typedef or \#define really is)
-   be aware of "wchar\_t as built-in type or not" issue


**Update:** turns out it's a known problem and has been blogged about on [official Visual Studio
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/vsdteam/archive/2005/11/16/linker_error_lnk2019_lnk2001.aspx). Good news is that it will probably be fixed in future versions of Visual Studio.
