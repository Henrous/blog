Probably won't last long, but you can download new fonts included with
Vista (Longhorn)
[here](http://test.uxevolutions.info/zoronax/entries/10).

I took a quick look at monospaced font "Consola" (for source code
editing) and it looks good (although to really make an informed opinion
about a font, I would have to live with it for some time).
