I just released a small program [scdiff](/software/scdiff/). It is a
Windows program that (graphically) shows a diff of local changes in CVS
or Subversion repository. Ideal for previewing the changes before
checking them in. It's clearly a tool for developers. Requires .NET
Framework 1.1 and only works on Windows.
